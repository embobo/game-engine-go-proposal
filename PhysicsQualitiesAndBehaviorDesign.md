# Physics Objects Ideas

## Behaviors (Non-intelligent)

This section lists behaviors and reactions our physical objects would like to exhibit

| Behavior | List of Qualities related to this behavior |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Falling** | Mass, surface area |
| **Stretchiness** | Elasticity |
| **Stickiness** | Adhesion, Electromagnetism |
| **Breakage** | Elasticity, Material state, crystalline/amorphous |

## Qualities

This section breaks down qualities needed, how to represent them, and what they are if not clear

* Mass - int/float
* Charge - int/float? - total electrical charge of an object (cumulative/atomic?)
* Polarity - ?? - charge differential over body
* Elasticity - [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law#Hooke.27s_law_for_continuous_media)) - ability to deform under external force
* Adhesion - ?? - stickiness
