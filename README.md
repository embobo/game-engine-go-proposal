# USING GO TO WRITE A PHYSICS SYSTEM

Authors: Emma Bobola and Janna Shaftan

## Proposal

For our project idea we would like to write a physics system or particle system using the ['Go' programming language](https://golang.org/doc/). This language is new to both of us. We will be referencing open source engines and [this example by Brian Ustas](https://github.com/ustasb/emoji_soup) to lay out the basics of the engine. We will then start with vector and force implementations to get familiar with the 'Go' language. After this we will turn our attention to the architecture of an event driven physics or particle system engine. If there is time at the end of the semester we would like to contribute our work to the [Azul3D](https://azul3d.org/) engine which is a very young open source engine written in Go and [available on Github](https://github.com/azul3d).

The results of this project will be displayed in a youtube video or web app.

## Possible Physics to implement:

* Applied force
* Drag/Friction
* Elasticity
* Attraction/Repulsion
* Adhesion
